# 🎲 Randomizer Plugin

## 📌 Description
The **Randomizer Plugin** is a Minecraft gameplay plugin that completely changes how block breaking works.  
Whenever a player breaks a block, they receive a **random block or item** instead of the original one.

The random outcome is based on a **balanced random system (1–10)** and is carefully designed to ensure that the game is **fully beatable**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- A player breaks **any block**
- The broken block is replaced by a **random block or item**
- The random system uses values from **1 to 10**
- Every important item required to **finish the game** is always obtainable

This means:
- You can still reach the **Nether**
- You can still access the **End**
- You can still defeat the **Ender Dragon**

The plugin is designed so that **no run becomes impossible**.

## 🏆 Balanced & Winnable
Unlike pure random plugins, this Randomizer is **carefully balanced**:
- Essential items (e.g. tools, progression blocks, eyes of ender components, etc.) are guaranteed to exist
- Randomness is controlled to avoid softlocks
- Every world can be completed from start to finish
